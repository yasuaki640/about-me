# About

I'm web developer writing PHP, Laravel, JS, Vue and more.

I like to write programs and study information engineering as a hobby in my private life, and often upload my codes to Github and blogs.

I also recently started OSS contributions little by little.

Other than programming, my hobby is playing drums, and I go to sessions regardless of genre, such as jazz and rock.
